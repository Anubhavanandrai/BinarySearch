# BinarySearch

Look generally when we dont know solution we try to solve any question in O(n^2) then to O(n) and then to O(log n)
Binary Search is a tool to do it in O(log n)

LIMITATION : We can use it only when array is SORTED.

//374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
This question is just similar to normal binary search just inplace of mid comparison we are comparing it with guess api()
